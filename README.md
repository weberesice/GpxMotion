# GpxMotion ownCloud/Nextcloud application

GpxMotion is an ownCloud/Nextcloud application to create and display path animations on an interactive map.

To produce an animation, go to GpxMotion main page and load a GPX file with ordered tracks/routes.
Then define the animation steps. Then check you are satisfied with the animation preview. Then
save the result to a GPX file.

To watch an animation, go to the "View" page of GpxMotion and load a GPX file. In the "view" page, if the file is
publicly shared without password in "Files" app, you can produce a GpxMotion public link to
the current animation with the "Share" button.

This app is tested on ownCloud 10 with Firefox and Chromium.
This app is tested on Nextcloud 11 and 12 with Firefox and Chromium.

Any feedback will be appreciated.
