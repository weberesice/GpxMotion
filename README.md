# GpxTravelAnim

Gpx travel animator is a web application which displays a map and animated markers
moving on a travel path.

The path, vehicules, descriptions and pictures can be defined in the ```metadata -> desc```
field of a gpx file.

This JS program will certainly be converted to a Nextcloud app one day.
